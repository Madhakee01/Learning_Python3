- Interpreters translate line by line  and execute the line before going to the next line compilers translate all the lines of program. 

- Python uses an interpreter rather than a compiler. (Translates our code to machine language. 

- Interpreter C Python  creates something called a byte code. 
- The byte code is run on the Python Virtual Machine that creates the machine code.

- Python can be used for small scripts, extensive data science and machine learning.

Python 2 vs Python3 creator Guido

Python is named after a British Company

- programming languages are evolving they are constantly updated.
- python 3 is completely different from python 2 because it had completely different new features. 
- so python 2 and python 3 became completely different. 

Ex. Python 2 print statement is >>>> print 'Hello, Geeks'

    Python 3 print statement is >>>> print('hello python 3 lovers')

Python 2 is gonna become a legacy by 2020. So the industry would completely be moving to Python3.
