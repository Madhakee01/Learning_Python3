- Interpreters translate line by line  and execute the line before going to the next line compilers translate all the lines of program. 

- Python uses an interpreter rather than a compiler. (Translates our code to machine language. 

- Interpreter C Python  creates something called a byte code. 
- The byte code is run on the Python Virtual Machine that creates the machine code.

- Python can be used for small scripts, extensive data science and machine learning.
