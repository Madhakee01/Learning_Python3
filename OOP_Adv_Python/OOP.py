#object oriented programming in python


#everythinig in Python is an object

print("all the data types in Python")
print(type(None))
print(type(True))
print(type(5))
print(type(5.5))
print(type('hi'))
print(type([]))
print(type(()))
print(type({}))

#objects have methods and attributes 
# you create your own objects using the class keyword. 

 #  more and more technology requires thousands of lines. so you need classes

 #for example Amazon Delivery Drones can be broken down into different functionality and each can be its own classes

 #OOP is a paradigm is a way to think about our code and structure the code.
