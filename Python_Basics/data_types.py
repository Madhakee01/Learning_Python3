# manipulate data values. they are the fundamental of dattattypes.

#specialized data types - packages or modules. 


#int and float 
# all numbers are stored in memory as binary. 

print(2+4)
print( type(2 + 4)) # class 'int'>
print(2-4)
print(2*4)
print(type(2/4))
print(type(0)) # 0 is of a type int

print(type(10.56)) # this stores more in memory because of the floiat type. 

print(5 % 4) # modular to get the remainder is 1
# float + float is float. 

print( 2 ** 2) # the power of 2 , ** power symbol



#math functions are like actions .

#operator precedence.
# python interpreter will follow the basic set of rules
